# 💦 Template Package

Easy-to-use template for TypeScript libraries for UI or Node.js. It's made for personal use but open for everyone to contribute or suggest improvements.

## 🚀 Why Use This Template?

Skip the setup and dive right into coding. This toolkit is perfect for any TypeScript package, packed with best practices.

## ✨ Motivation

This template is my own solution, born out of a desire to have a setup that fits just right for me. I was aware of [create-typescript-app](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app), yet I chose to make my own. Through this process, I am continuously gaining valuable insights and skills, and I intend to keep refining this template as I learn more.

## 🌟 Getting Started

To kick off with this template, choose any of these methods. Don't forget to run `pnpm run init` to customize it for your project (not needed for the NPX script):

- **Use Template on GitHub**: Just click 'Use this template'.
  - ❤️ This method helps promote this repository to new interested developers.
- **Git Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/mxmalykhin/template-package.git your-library-name`.
- **Download ZIP**: Just download and unzip.
- **NPX Script**: (Coming Soon) `npx template-package init` will do all the setup for you.

👍 **Tip**: 'Use this template' on GitHub is quick and shares the love. NPX script will make it even easier soon.

🐣 **Next Steps**: Once the template is installed, `pnpm run init` gets your template tailored to your needs.

## 🛠 Development Tools

I use `esbuild` for speedy development builds (`pnpm run dev`) and `rollup-plugin-typescript2` for more thorough type checking in production builds (`pnpm run build`). This ensures fast iteration and reliable code.

## 🧪 Test Your Work

Before sharing your library, test it in real projects to ensure it works as expected:

- **npm link**: Great for local testing.
- **yarn link/pnpm link**: Alternative options that work similarly to `pnpm link`.

## 🔧 Environment Support

Supports ESM/CJS/UMD/IIFE for broad compatibility. This template is designed to work in Node.js, the browser, and other environments.

## 🔍 ESM-Centric Approach

Striving for a "first-class solution" in ESM, this template is an endeavor to stay at the forefront of JavaScript development practices, ensuring efficiency and modern standards are met.

## 💡 Contributing
